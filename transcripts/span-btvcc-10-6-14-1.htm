    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Mason</span><span><a data-m="73800" class="thewords">Thank you, President Shannon.  I&#x27;d like to move the agenda as presented with the following amendments.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="159400" class="thewords">Any opposed&#x3f;  That&#x27;s unanimous.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="163200" class="thewords">Next item on our agenda is our annual report from the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="173400" class="thewords">Welcome, Commissioner Montroll.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="177900" class="thewords">Good evening, thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="178300" class="thewords">Welcome back.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="179300" class="thewords">Thank you.  Pleasure to be here.  So I&#x27;m Andy Montroll, I&#x27;m your representative to the Regional Planning Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="187600" class="thewords">I was hoping our alternate rep was going to be here also, but I understand he&#x27;s not able to make it &#x5b;unintelligible&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="195600" class="thewords">He had been planning on coming, so apologize for his not being here.  But you have our annual report.  It’s been a very exciting year at the Regional Planning Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="204000" class="thewords">There&#x27;s been a lot of activity that&#x27;s been happening. In our report we break it down into activities that are going on here in Burlington and regional activities.  Beyond what’s here, what you see in the activities that are going on in Burlington, there are similar type of activities, although probably not as many, going on in all of the other member municipalities in the county.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="226400" class="thewords">So it’s been very active.  When I was here last year, and in other times, I think, we&#x27;ve talked about the ECOS Project, which is essentially the regional plan.  It incorporates the regional plan plus the transportation plan, plus other plans.  And that was done about two years ago.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="246600" class="thewords">And a lot of the work that we&#x27;ve been doing since then really focuses on that and builds off of that, and starts to implement some of the programs that that was recommending.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="257100" class="thewords">I also just want to let you know I was elected as the chair of the Regional Planning Commission last spring.  So I&#x27;m pleased to serve in that capacity.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="267000" class="thewords">I was also the chair of, essentially it’s the budget committee for coming up with the budget for this next year, and it was very helpful hearing from folks at Public Works and others who let me know what the priorities for the city were, so I can make sure that those were being incorporated into the work plan for this year that we&#x27;re in right now.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="286500" class="thewords">And one other piece that&#x27;s been important to us and, and to me, is really trying to help promote communications with the Regional Planning Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="295600" class="thewords">And promote better outreach.  And hopefully you&#x27;ve all been getting, like, monthly updates from the Regional Planning Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="302900" class="thewords">There are newsletters are emailed to everybody.  If you&#x27;re not getting that, let me know, but they go into quite a bit of depth over what we&#x27;re doing.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="309600" class="thewords">The website also makes sure it’s kept up&#x2d;to&#x2d;date with all the different meetings that are going on, the different projects that are going on.  So if you ever want to know what’s happening, first feel free to contact me, but also look at the website.  There&#x27;s a whole wealth of information there.  And with that, I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions that you have.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="327900" class="thewords">Thank you, Commissioner Montroll.  Do we have any questions&#x3f;  Councilor Bushor&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Bushor</span><span><a data-m="334800" class="thewords">I don&#x27;t have questions, but first of all I want to congratulate you on being elected chair.  I think regional planning is in good hands.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="345100" class="thewords">The other thing is I just wanted to let you know that every time you reach out to a community and partner with them to work on a plan, a complete street, I feel that your staff, the staff there are so professional and really help get everyone around the table, and help to bring to closure a plan or a pilot project that is representative of input from the community.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="378700" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve been very impressed with that process, and I just want you to know that as a commissioner, that I think this organization serves Chittenden County very well.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="392500" class="thewords">And I had reservations when there was the merger of transportation and planning together.  But I think it’s been a very good uniting of those two issues, which really are intertwined anyway.  So I just wanted to give you that positive feedback.  Thank you very much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="410900" class="thewords">And the report was, I really liked the way you divided into Burlington and then the rest of the region.  It was very readable.  Thanks.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="417500" class="thewords">Good, thank you, and I&#x27;ll bring those comments back.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="422000" class="thewords">Thank you.  Councilor Wright&#x3f;  Before you speak, let me just make a brief announcement.  We have a lot of people to speak here at public forum, and I know we also have some young kids in the room.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="434000" class="thewords">So Mike is trying to collect names of people who have young kids here or other urgent reasons that they might need to speak sooner rather than later.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="445300" class="thewords">If you give your name to Mike, I&#x27;ll do what I can to move you to... Mike, can you raise your hand and wave&#x3f; Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="454400" class="thewords">We&#x27;ll do what we can to facilitate that.  So, sorry, Councilor Wright.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Wright</span><span><a data-m="457900" class="thewords">That&#x27;s all right, President Shannon, thank you.  Really no question.  Andy, just wanted to sort of echo what Councilor Bushor said.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="465100" class="thewords">Thank you for your service, great job, and it’s always good to see you back here in Contois where you spent so many years.  Thanks.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="472500" class="thewords">Well, thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="475900" class="thewords">Thank you, Councilor Wright.  Councilor Siegel.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Siegel</span><span><a data-m="478200" class="thewords">Thank you very much, President Shannon, and thank you for coming, and thank you to those who had to amend the agenda and change this to tonight.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="484700" class="thewords">That was at my request, and I really do appreciate the opportunity to speak to you directly and to recognize the work that&#x27;s been done.  To folks in the public or watching on channel 17, what we&#x27;re talking about might not be clear.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="497300" class="thewords">CCRPC is a pretty big mouthful.  It’s the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission.  And to a lot of people that sounds like roads and buildings and infrastructure.  But it’s also about people, and the ECOS Project really exemplifies that.  And I was just so excited when I heard about the diversity and equity efforts that are happening within it, and in particular, the Leadership Training For People of Color Program that was piloted last year.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="530800" class="thewords">And I was at one of the commemorative events at the end of it, and know some of the folks who participated.  And it was very valuable.  Not just for those individuals, but it in the end will be valuable for all of us, who will get more leadership from people who we don&#x27;t always see in leadership positions.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="554300" class="thewords">So I had two questions regarding what you put in the report about the diversity and equity.  One is that it mentions that you&#x27;re updating the Public Participation Plan, and a public hearing is expected in September of 2014.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="571400" class="thewords">I&#x27;m curious if that happened and I missed it, or if it’s coming.</a></span></span></p>
    <p><p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="574700" class="thewords">It didn’t happen yet.  I had prepared the report in I think early August, and the hope was it was going to be on our agenda in September.  It wasn&#x27;t finished yet, and so we put if off.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="586800" class="thewords">It’s supposed to be on our agenda on the third Wednesday this month in October.  I&#x27;m still optimistic it’s going to be.  I think they still need to have a final meeting of the group that&#x27;s working on that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="599900" class="thewords">Assuming they&#x27;re able to complete their work, it will be on our agenda, and I&#x27;m hopeful that&#x27;s going to happen, because we want to move forward with it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="607600" class="thewords">We would see the public hearing on the agenda for the upcoming meeting&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="610900" class="thewords">Yes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="611200" class="thewords">Of how to find out&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="612000" class="thewords">Yes. It’s the third Wednesday of the month.  
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="616000" class="thewords">Okay, that&#x27;s great. I didn’t mean to criticize at all.  That stuff happens.  It’s hard, you know, hard to know.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="620700" class="thewords">And then my question, my other question is about the leadership training.  And it was a pilot program, it was successful, and there&#x27;s no reference as to whether it’s going to continue.  And I know that Sarah Osaba, who led it and really, I think, created it in a lot of ways, made it happen, is now out of state.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="642100" class="thewords">And so without her being there, will somebody else fill that gap&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="648600" class="thewords">I hope so.  As you were pointing out, it was a really successful program last year that ended in June, and there was a kind of a graduation ceremony at our annual meeting in June, where a number of folks who participate in it were recognized.  And I don&#x27;t know exactly yet what form it’s going to take on, because as you pointed out, Sarah has gone.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="671400" class="thewords">But I&#x27;m hopeful that we&#x27;ll be able to continue with something, either with the same program or something like it.  I think it’s something that we&#x27;ve targeted as being really important to be able to reach out to a broader community, and it’s more than just reaching out.  It’s helping to make sure that people in all different parts of our community have the background to really be able to fully participate, and that&#x27;s what that program was all about, was helping give people the groundwork and the base so that they could participate more actively in other things.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="702500" class="thewords">And I know you partnered with quite a number of community organizations to make that happen financially and logistically, and I am assuming that they all are still interested and were happy with how it went.  So I hope that you&#x27;ll let Charlie know and let the rest of the commission know that we all are rootin&#x27; for you to do it again.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="724300" class="thewords">Great, absolutely, I&#x27;ll pass that on.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="725900" class="thewords">Yeah, thanks.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="728200" class="thewords">Thank you.  Anyone else&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="733500" class="thewords">Well, thank you very much for your service, Commissioner Montroll, and for coming here tonight.  And I know everybody knows that they can contact Andy if you have any questions or concerns.  So, thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cmr. Montroll</span><span><a data-m="746200" class="thewords">Great.  Thank you very much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="750300" class="thewords">I think normally we wouldn&#x27;t go to public forum until 7:30, but given that I have maybe 50 people who want to speak, I think we can get right to that.  And anybody who comes at 7:30 won&#x27;t have missed it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="768400" class="thewords">So if there&#x27;s no objection, we&#x27;ll just go directly to that.  And I only have, I have two people...</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="782500" class="thewords">I have two speakers with children that I&#x27;m going to put at the top of the pile, and otherwise take them in the order I receive them.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="789800" class="thewords">The first — so I&#x27;ll just remind people, you&#x27;ll have two minutes to speak, and the lights at the table will go on.  When you start talking, the green light will go on.  When you need to wrap up your comments, the yellow light will go on.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="802600" class="thewords">And when you need to end your comments, the red light would go on.  And I&#x27;d appreciate it if people would really tightly respect the lights tonight, &#x27;cause we do have so many speakers and we want to hear from everybody.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="815700" class="thewords">Please address your comments to me.  We try to not make anything personal.  We want to hear from you about the issues.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="822500" class="thewords">It’s easier for us to hear your comments if you can address in a respectful way.  We really appreciate that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="832800" class="thewords">And I will let you know both who the speaker is and who is on deck.  So our first speaker is Sarah Goodrich, followed by Jenny &#x5b;Cathcart&#x5d;.  Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="842200" class="thewords">And also if you can pull the mike right up — not you, silly.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="849400" class="thewords">That&#x27;s for mom.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cathcart</span><span><a data-m="853000" class="thewords">Hi, I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m going out of order, as I was the number two speaker, but I got the motion.  Is that okay&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="857000" class="thewords">Oh, okay, so you are Jenny Cathcart.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cathcart</span><span><a data-m="858900" class="thewords">Yes.  Hi, I&#x27;m Jenny Cathcart —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="859800" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cathcart</span><span><a data-m="862800" class="thewords">And I live at 37 Laurel Court.  So we&#x27;re in the Crescent Beach neighborhood, and I&#x27;m here with my three kiddos.  Five, three and one.  Two of whom already ride their bikes without training wheels.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="873500" class="thewords">So we moved to Burlington two and a half years ago from Madison, Wisconsin, where I was previously the Director of Marketing for Schwinn Bicycles, and a board member for the Wisconsin Bicycle Federation.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="884500" class="thewords">So biking is near and dear to my heart, and having livable, walkable, Complete Streets is very dear to my heart.  But now that... Hey, Emma.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="892700" class="thewords">Now, as a mom, it’s even more important to me, because as I looked at the plan, the very well thought out plan that you guys have conceived, I see that there are numerous intersections that my family uses regularly, as we go to Ethan Allen Park, as we go to Hannaford&#x27;s Plaza.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="906700" class="thewords">And we&#x27;re a family that walks and bikes and does a lot of errands.  And so the work that you guys are proposing is very important and very near and dear to my heart, and to those in... Shh, thank you.  And those in our neighborhood.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="919200" class="thewords">And I truly hope that you stay strong and vote yes to move forward with the proposed changes.  Thank you so much for listening, and thank you so much for all the hard work you&#x27;ve done on this issue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="931200" class="thewords">Thank you for making the effort to come out and talk to us.  Thank you all.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cathcart</span><span><a data-m="934500" class="thewords">&#x5b;laughs&#x5d;  Okay, sh.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="937100" class="thewords">Sarah Goodrich.  Oh.  Is Sarah here&#x3f;  If she comes back... is Sarah here&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="950100" class="thewords">No. Okay, if she comes back, just wave to me and hopefully I&#x27;ll recognize you and we can still hear from Sarah.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="957900" class="thewords">Next we have Chuck Norris Brown followed by Martha Lange.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Brown</span><span><a data-m="975400" class="thewords">Hello.  Chuck Norris Brown from Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="978700" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Brown</span><span><a data-m="979700" class="thewords">Thank you.  First of all, I wish to thank the Burlington City Council for allowing public input such as this as well as for listening.  We know you listen.  In my case, I&#x27;m referring to the support you showed the CCTA drivers during the strike.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="991600" class="thewords">Your involvement has led to constructive changes at CCTA, even as we speak, and I am sure the drivers who are here and the staff also, and the Board of Commissioner people who are here would agree.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1003000" class="thewords">I am sure they all want to work with you to continue to make the Burlington region a model for public transportation.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1009200" class="thewords">In this connection I want to refer to, among other things, Plan BTV, which clearly states among its goals environmental quality, social equity, and energy efficiency in transportation choices.  And I&#x27;m sure we can join hands with our bicycle colleagues here this evening, plus those who support public transportation here tonight and watching us across the airwaves to emphasize three reasons why Burlington cannot afford to drop the ball on the downtown transit center.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1034400" class="thewords">The downtown transit center will have highly improved driver room and facilities as well as shelter and better security for passengers.  It will also allow for better transfer protocol and ease bus crossings at Church Street.  Finally, Burlington is a city choked by cars.  In a way, the DTC symbolizes Burlington&#x27;s commitment to taking steps forward for public transportation and the livable city mentioned in Plan BTV.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1057300" class="thewords">We&#x27;re all on this bus together.  Please make the decision this evening that will provide the easement necessary to allow CCTA to move forward in building its downtown transit center.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1066800" class="thewords">Thank you.  Martha Lange, followed by Greg Roy.  You&#x27;re also welcome to come up and sit at the table if you like, if you&#x27;re the next in the queue.  Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Lange</span><span><a data-m="1079300" class="thewords">It’s two minutes, correct&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1080500" class="thewords">It’s two minutes, yes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Lange</span><span><a data-m="1082200" class="thewords">My name&#x27;s Martha Lange and I&#x27;m here to talk regarding the Taft School Lease.  I am opposed to the 160&#x2d;year lease of Taft School.  This deal is not in the best interest of the schoolchildren of Burlington, the taxpayers or Ward One residents.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1096800" class="thewords">Ward One will now be the only ward in Burlington without a school.  And the students at Taft, a group of the most neediest, vulnerable children in the city, are being displaced without any public information on where they&#x27;re going to be educated.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1112900" class="thewords">This sale does not honor the intent of Mr. Taft&#x27;s last will.  And I go on to discuss why.  The &#x24;1.6 million from this lease will be under the control of the Burlington School District, a group who recently took &#x24;210,000 from school maintenance money to buy 59 Murray Street, a building they are being forced to sell because they violated zoning regs.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1140400" class="thewords">This group, when they found out there was a &#x24;2.3 million school deficit, debated whether or not the taxpayer would even be told about it.  Eventually there will be a change in school commissioners.  What guarantees do we have that the &#x24;1.6 million from Taft School won&#x27;t be as horribly disrespected as the intent of Mr. Taft&#x27;s will and testament&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1168400" class="thewords">And what’s &#x24;1.6 million compared to &#x24;14 million that the city misappropriated for Burlington Telecom under the advice of the same law firm representing the school district&#x3f;  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1182100" class="thewords">Thank you.  I would like to...  Is Sarah Goodrich here&#x3f;  She did.  Okay.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1193100" class="thewords">If she comes back, let me know.  Mr. Roy&#x3f;  Welcome.  Followed by RJ &#x5b;La Lumiere&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Roy</span><span><a data-m="1205500" class="thewords">Thank you very much, Madam President, for allowing me to address the council.  My name is Greg Roy, I live on Dale Road in North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1213300" class="thewords">First of all, I think we probably should&#x27;ve brought in some tubular police barriers so that we&#x27;d have a place for all the extra bikes that showed up tonight.  If everybody leaves at once, it’s gonna look like Beijing out there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1225700" class="thewords">On the subject of the North Avenue Corridor Study and Project now, I would hope that this gets treated like the pilot project that it is.  Personally, I wasn&#x27;t in favor of it from the beginning, and I didn’t really like the end product.  I don&#x27;t think that roundabouts are going to be safe for &#x5b;stop&#x5d; control and crosswalks, lights.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1246300" class="thewords">And I don&#x27;t think reducing the width is going to help, either.  Road diets work some places, like on Colchester Avenue.  It seems to be the fix for there, but I&#x27;ve heard people complaining in South Burlington about the Shelburne Road road diet, and they don&#x27;t like it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1263200" class="thewords">So I would just hope that you would adopt Councilor Wright&#x27;s amendment to bring this back to the people and check in after the project, &#x22;pilot project&#x22;, is in force.  Let&#x27;s just have a word back from the people, if they like it, if they don&#x27;t like it, and let&#x27;s fix it from there.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1281100" class="thewords">Thank you.  RJ La Lumiere, followed by Paul Kemptner.  Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">La Lumiere</span><span><a data-m="1296500" class="thewords">Hi.  I&#x27;m from Ward Seven, I&#x27;m a homeowner up there.  And I&#x27;d just like to say that I support the proposal as it is with no amendments.  Maintaining any on&#x2d;street parking seriously compromises the safety of cyclists, and we like to ride our bikes, we like to walk a lot.  We walk down to Hannaford&#x27;s because it’s not safe for her to ride there, although it should be — it’s very close.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1326900" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve heard some effort to frame this as just a New North End issue, but that&#x27;s not the case.  It’s imperative that we have a full network across the whole city, so that we can go to school, so we can go to the library, so that we can go to the store and church.  And disconnected pieces of intimidating infrastructure don&#x27;t make that possible for us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1354300" class="thewords">And so I would just ask also that we let the pilot project run long enough that we can collect meaningful data, let people get used to the new configuration, and don&#x27;t prejudge it.  Thank you very much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1371400" class="thewords">Thank you.  I should&#x27;ve noted at the beginning of the meeting that we have Councilor Legrand on the phone.  So she has been participating through the whole meeting and she is hearing the public comment right now.  Councilor Legrand, you&#x27;re there, right&#x3f;  Probably on mute.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1393600" class="thewords">Councilor Legrand&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Legrand</span><span><a data-m="1394400" class="thewords">Yes, I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1395700" class="thewords">Okay, thank you.  Just confirming.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Kemptner</span><span><a data-m="1398400" class="thewords">My name is Paul Kemptner.  I live in the New North End on Cumberland Road, and I want to say that I want to speak in favor of the amendment as it stands without any amendments.  I have lived there for quite some time, and starting when I was about 50, I started bike commuting year&#x2d;round to downtown Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1420400" class="thewords">My wife still bike commutes.  She works out at Fanny Allen, and often has to return quite late at night.  And in the winter there are no options.  Options imply that you have choices.  But in the winter there are no options for commuting.  There&#x27;s North Avenue or North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1441400" class="thewords">So, and I&#x27;ve ridden that throughout the winter, and it’s difficult and dangerous.  One of the arguments that I&#x27;ve heard that people have said that they would not support it, is that it might make their commutes longer.  But there&#x27;s never been any discussion that if more people were riding their bike, there&#x27;d be less cars.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1463500" class="thewords">So I would offer that to you as for something to think about.  I&#x27;ve often heard it suggested the bike path be plowed, but often got the response that it would put too much salt near the lake.  And so in the winter the bike path is not an option.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1486300" class="thewords">North Avenue is the only way to go.  So, I want to speak in favor of this.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1493800" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Kemptner</span><span><a data-m="" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1496400" class="thewords">Andrea, followed by Mike Walden.  Andrea did not give me a last name.  But wanted to speak to bike safety&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1515200" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Todd</span><span><a data-m="" class="thewords">Sorry about that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1516600" class="thewords">I&#x27;m Andrea Todd, is my last name.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1517800" class="thewords">You were probably here before it was really really crowded —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Todd</span><span><a data-m="1520200" class="thewords">Yes.  &#x5b;laughs&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1520400" class="thewords">— and thought &#x5b;unintelligible&#x5d;.  Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Todd</span><span><a data-m="1522600" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thank you for letting me speak about this issue.  I&#x27;m a bike commuter year&#x2d;round, with studs in the winter, and with my t&#x2d;shirt in the summer.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1534400" class="thewords">I think this is a really appropriate time to speak about bike safety, in lieu  of last week&#x27;s pedestrian and bicycle accidents that happened in the city.  So I think that really puts a good framework of discussion of safety of the people who are trying to live in Burlington and commute through Burlington&#x27;s streets.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1556500" class="thewords">This project and proposal, I&#x27;m in strong support of because of its ability to allow more people to get on bikes and drive through the city.  It’s not a one or the other option.  This solution allows both to work together.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1572300" class="thewords">And as someone who is in traffic day in and day out, the idea of a buffer area of something that can protect me from traffic and cars that might hit me is really appealing.  This has an opportunity to actually make Burlington a truly bikeable and truly livable city that it is often espoused  to be.  So please support and put your money really behind the promise of a livable, bikeable Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1603400" class="thewords">Thank you.  And I&#x27;m going to go to somebody who has small children here.  Kate Whitman, followed by Mike Walden.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1623400" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Whitman</span><span><a data-m="1624000" class="thewords">Hi, thanks.  Thanks for taking us.  And, Kate Whitman — this is Ezra. I live in the New North End —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1630300" class="thewords">If you can try to speak into the microphone — I realize you have other challenges —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Whitman</span><span><a data-m="1633800" class="thewords">Hello.  Kate Whitman — this is Ezra.  I live in the New North End.  And I used to be a 12&#x2d;month bike commuter when I lived in a place where I felt safe.  This was before kids.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1647800" class="thewords">I hope to be at some point, but the realistic short term for me is being able to ride my bike to get groceries, go to the post office, go to UVM, go to work, and I wholeheartedly support the proposal as it’s written now.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1663400" class="thewords">I think the comments about bike safety, I agree with.  The comments about having a good option in the wintertime — I tried it a couple times and I didn’t feel safe, especially at night.  So it’s my hope that a protected bike lane would allow me to be safer.  So thanks for giving me the time.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1683200" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Whitman</span><span><a data-m="1685700" class="thewords">Oh, and I would take him with me sometimes.  &#x5b;laughs&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1689700" class="thewords">Mike Walden, followed... Walker&#x3f;  Yeah, that could be it.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d; Followed by Rich Nadworthy.  Thanks for being patient.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Walker</span><span><a data-m="1703300" class="thewords">Hi, my name&#x27;s Mike Walker, I live out in the Burlington North End.  I guess you&#x27;re asking for a bike path down North Avenue&#x3f;  To me, if you want something for safety and riding in the winter and whatever, I suggest we have a bus that goes out there.  North Avenue is narrow enough as it is.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1726000" class="thewords">You have children riding in the roads, you have people riding in the roads, and none of &#x27;em follow the rules of the road.  As a bus driver, I find it very dangerous to be asking people be in the road.  There&#x27;s other ways that they can get around, and I don&#x27;t support the bike path out on North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1745700" class="thewords">Also, I was asked about the bus terminal.  I was told it was too late to say anything.  But I don&#x27;t feel that that bus terminal is in the right position.  That should be out on Pine Street, where the old bus, Vermont Transit Terminal was.  And to me that would make a better position than where it is now, because being located on St. Paul Street, it’s not taking care of any of the safety issues or whatever.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1775700" class="thewords">Like I said, we still have bicycles passing us on the right and whatever.  We have delivery trucks and whatever.  &#x27;Course, I guess that&#x27;s already been voted on.  But I just figured I&#x27;d say my piece on it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1788000" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Walker</span><span><a data-m="" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Whitman</span><span><a data-m="1790000" class="thewords">Rich Nadworthy followed by John Black.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1798000" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Nadworny</span><span><a data-m="1798700" class="thewords">Hello.  I&#x27;m Rich Nadworny, Joan, and I live in the New North End, and I&#x27;m here to ask for your support for the North Avenue Corridor pilot. You know as well as I there are a lot of exciting things happening in Burlington.  The amazing Pine Street Corridor is about to receive even more investment through the South End Connector.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1821400" class="thewords">Our great downtown and waterfronts are starting new, exciting projects this year and next year.  And the Old North End continues to renew itself, making it into one of the most interesting and diverse communities in Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1836600" class="thewords">And yet all of that creativity and innovation and investment seems to stop dead in its tracks as soon as you get north of the high school.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1848500" class="thewords">Through workshops that I arrange and meetings that I attend and conversations that I have, I find an overwhelming desire from New North End residents to be better connected to and more integrated with the rest of the city.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1865500" class="thewords">But to do that, we&#x27;re going to need your help to start putting the &#x22;new&#x22; back in the New North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1873300" class="thewords">And that&#x27;s why, as a small step, I want you to support the North Avenue Corridor pilot and do your best to resist the last&#x2d;minute amendments, and to respect all of the hard work being done by our citizens and experts over the past 18 months.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1892000" class="thewords">But we&#x27;re gonna need your support to put that creativity and innovation and investment into the North End in the same way that you&#x27;ve done to support that in the rest of the city.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1906500" class="thewords">Thank you, Mr. Nadworny.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1910000" class="thewords">I understand Sarah Goodrich is with us.  Is that...&#x3f; Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Goodrich</span><span><a data-m="1917900" class="thewords">Thank you very much.  I&#x27;m Sarah Goodrich.  Trying to manage tonight with my toddler here.  But... I just wanted to come and give my full support for a complete street on North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1928700" class="thewords">I live in the New North End.  I have an almost three&#x2d;year&#x2d;old, and as it is now, I don&#x27;t feel safe biking on North Avenue.  But with buffered bike lanes on both sides for the entire avenue, I would feel safe riding my bicycle into downtown, which would be fantastic for us.  So I would just like to see North Avenue serve pedestrians and bicyclists as well as motorists.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1954100" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Goodrich</span><span><a data-m="1954600" class="thewords">That&#x27;s about it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="1956300" class="thewords">John Black, followed by Eric Brown&#x2d;&#x5b;Brauts&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Black</span><span><a data-m="1964000" class="thewords">Good evening.  I live right on, kind of right across from Burlington College, and I&#x27;m kind of somewhere in between, I feel like Hannaford&#x27;s and City Market.  And it would mean kinda the world to me to be able to feel safe, just to bike to Hannaford&#x27;s.  As kind of a less expensive option for me, as well as kinda healthier option than the Mobil just down the street.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="1993800" class="thewords">It would mean a better quality of life, I think, for myself.  Not only spending less money, but also just that kind of peace of mind.  The only reason I don&#x27;t go down that way is just because the Burlington Bike Path is just a little bit too far out of the way.  Also, as other people have mentioned, impassable in the winter.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2017500" class="thewords">But I definitely enjoy really kind of just having that peace of mind, biking on North Ave.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2026800" class="thewords">Thank you.  Eric Brown&#x2d;Brauts, followed by Gary &#x5b;Dion&#x5d;.  Okay, thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2039300" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Brown&#x2d;Brauts</span><span><a data-m="2040700" class="thewords">Hi, thank you.  My name&#x27;s Eric Brown&#x2d;Brauts.  I live in the South End.  I&#x27;m the chair of the Burlington Walk&#x2f;Bike Council.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2047500" class="thewords">And I would like to ask for your support for the North Avenue Study recommendations without amendment.  This is an important upgrade, both short&#x2d;term and long&#x2d;term.  And won&#x27;t talk about everything that all the other people are talking about.  I want to specifically address — well, first I want to acknowledge the long&#x2d;term vision of a complete street, cycle &#x5b;track&#x5d;, intersection improvements, roundabouts, all of which, the details of which will be worked out in the future.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2079700" class="thewords">But it’s important to set the vision today for where that could go.  I particularly want to address some of the particulars of the North Avenue recommendations.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2092000" class="thewords">The four&#x2d;to&#x2d;three&#x2d;lane conversion is critical to allow any biking at all in that section and improve safety and ridership in the North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2104200" class="thewords">The removal of on&#x2d;street parking — I understand there&#x27;s an amendment proposed to allow parking still on one side of the street.  Bike lanes, as RJ was saying, next to parking are dangerous, with the possible of &#x22;dooring.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2124300" class="thewords">Someone was killed not too long ago in New Hampshire, I believe, by being &#x22;doored.&#x22;  And in addition, having sparsely populated parking along the corridor as it is now will encourage people to weave in and out, which again makes for unpredictable behavior, and reduces safety both for cars and bikers.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2149600" class="thewords">And I&#x27;m losing time.  I particularly want to make sure that we preserve a protected bike lane between — if it can&#x27;t be in the section currently proposed — to Washington Street and Institute Road.  &#x5b;beep&#x5d; Thanks.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2166900" class="thewords">Thank you.  Gary Dion followed by Patrick Johnson.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Dion</span><span><a data-m="2175700" class="thewords">My name&#x27;s Gary Dion and I&#x27;m from Ward Seven.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2178000" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Dion</span><span><a data-m="2178700" class="thewords">And first of all, I&#x27;d like to thank the mayor for an outstanding job in reference to many, many issues that should&#x27;ve been taken care of years ago, and also the city council, for your participation and working with the mayor.  And especially on the F&#x2d;35.  That was an outstanding job that you all did, and I appreciate it, and I know the City of Burlington and the State of Vermont cares for what you did.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2213600" class="thewords">But one thing I would like to say on reference to the North Avenue Corridor, at the present time right now, I take my granddaughter to school, roughly around eight, to Hunt School.  There&#x27;s bumper to bumper traffic from Merola&#x27;s store all the way to Heineberg.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2230400" class="thewords">And as I make my left&#x2d;hand turn and I look down the road, it opens up to the four lanes, and there&#x27;s a bus down the road, and there&#x27;s another backup of traffic.  What I&#x27;m saying is you make it two lanes, when service vehicles, including the bus and other modes of transportation try to make a turn, and if you&#x27;re behind &#x27;em, and there&#x27;s only one other lane to go into, you&#x27;re backed up.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2265600" class="thewords">Today I was on Riverside Avenue and I was heading back home, and there was a bus that was letting people off.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Johnson</span><span><a data-m="2340300" class="thewords">I hate traffic too.  That&#x27;s why I bike.  And hopefully it will encourage more people to bike with bike lanes.  There is a concern of mine, which is the current bike lane situation we have in the city is two white lines, which does not encumber drivers from crossing.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2361600" class="thewords">All the time you see it as a biker — they&#x27;ll pull over to turn right, and then you&#x27;re over on the side.  The amendment this evening to strike out wording, starting on line 72, to eliminate protected bike lanes and flexible posts, is completely unacceptable.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2383400" class="thewords">I have the right to be protected, like cars have the right for traffic stop signs, yield signs and the other basic necessities of travel.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2394200" class="thewords">You probably already all have had this debate, I&#x27;m sure.  I&#x27;ve been hit three times.  I don&#x27;t wish to be hit again.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2402000" class="thewords">There&#x27;s a lotta other people here that have been hit as well.  I know for a fact, striking protected bike lanes from this project will encourage drivers to drift.  Thank you.</a></span></p>

I&#x27;m also a business owner there, as a lot of you know.  I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;ve been through every iteration of this bus thing.  I&#x27;ve been — transit center, sorry — living there over ten years.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2446600" class="thewords">I know we need a transit center. This is the best possible location as far as all the iterations that have come to do it in the core.  My concerns are the easements on Pearl Street, and how it will affect the residents, especially the people who are in wheelchairs.  I would like to see at least one handicapped&#x2d;accessible spot there, because currently the spots that they&#x27;re going for the easements on are where people park who are in wheelchairs, who come to my businesses.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2472600" class="thewords">And also they have asked me, &#x27;cause they can&#x27;t get here at night, to express their concern about that.  I don&#x27;t know if the crosswalks are going to change.  I&#x27;d like to know that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2482500" class="thewords">I&#x27;m kinda concerned that we just spent a lot of money doing a lot of improvements to these streets, and it seems like they&#x27;re going to be, the improvements are going to be taken out.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2492100" class="thewords">And mainly, it looks like there will be six spaces left on the south side of Pearl Street.  I would like to ensure that those don&#x27;t get fed by meter feeders who sit there all day.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2505800" class="thewords">And just concerned for everybody in the neighborhood.  And that&#x27;s it.  Thanks.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2529400" class="thewords">If you could speak up a little bit, and into the microphone, we could hear you better.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Mylins</span><span><a data-m="2535200" class="thewords">I work in the center of Burlington, and am very familiar with the many ways to commute in — by bus, car, biking, and yes, walking as well.  I do them all.  Like many others, I also make many short trips along North Avenue, again, by car, bike and&#x2f;or on foot on a pretty frequent basis.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2553600" class="thewords">The posts in Front Porch Forum have too frequently seemed to be drivers versus cyclists.  I think we have lost sight of what the goals should be.  To quote a recent posting to Front Porch Forum, &#x22;The real issue here is what is the best way for cars, bicycles, buses and pedestrians to share North Avenue&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2574000" class="thewords">I urge the council to support the plan that addresses these issues this evening.  Cars will have dedicated lanes, cyclists will have dedicated lanes, a pilot project to test the viability of going from four lanes to three, improved crossings for pedestrians, i.e. more crossings.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2592700" class="thewords">The pilot project of going from four to three lanes should be designed with specific measurements and&#x2f;or data collection in order to properly assess the impact and effectiveness of the north&#x2f;south lanes and a middle turn lane.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2605900" class="thewords">The implementations of many of the recommended changes will take time.  I believe that a lot of work has gone into this project over the past few months.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2614900" class="thewords">Let&#x27;s work to make the North Avenue Corridor safer for all of us, whether we be drivers, cyclists, walkers and&#x2f;or bus riders, or some combination thereof.  Thank you.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Harig</span><span><a data-m="2632100" class="thewords">Hello, my name is Joe Harig.  My wife and I purchased our home on Borestone Lane in Ward Seven two years ago.  We are a committed one&#x2d;car family.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2646500" class="thewords">My wife works downtown.  I work in Williston.  So we both often sometimes use public transportation as well as riding our bikes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2656000" class="thewords">I would ask you to support the North Ave. Corridor plan as it has been put forward, and to just ignore the two proposals, for the reasons that have been put forth already.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2670000" class="thewords">And just to speak on the two bike paths, neither the 127 or the waterfront bike path are lit.  So they&#x27;re kinda unusable at nighttime, and both of them both have large hills at the end of them.  There are many people who are not strong riders that couldn’t make it up that hill.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2688100" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve previously been struck by a motorist as well, and I have firsthand experience of the repercussions of that, and I can tell you it was not fun.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2695600" class="thewords">I was out of work for two months, and still suffer from hip pain.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2701700" class="thewords">Since we&#x27;ve moved to the New North End, my wife and I have had numerous experiences cycling on North Avenue in which motorists failed to give a reasonable amount of space while passing.  That&#x27;s to say nothing about the three feet that is supposedly state law that they&#x27;re supposed to be giving us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2719900" class="thewords">Also, Riverside Avenue has kind of a protected cycle track, and I&#x27;ve ridden on that several times and felt completely, like just completely safe riding on that.  It’s just way better than being on the street.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2735400" class="thewords">So I would also just like to express my gratitude to the TEUC and all the volunteers that have put in all the work to get us to where we are today.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2746500" class="thewords">Thank you.  Paulette Soufin followed by Glen &#x5b;Eames&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Soufin</span><span><a data-m="2753600" class="thewords">Hi, my name is Paulette Soufin.  I have a unique perspective. I live on North Avenue.  My kitchen window faces North Avenue.  And I can tell you the five years I&#x27;ve lived there, I have seen such a change in the number of pedestrians and bicyclers and weird contraptions of things that go by my window every morning, starting about seven o&#x27;clock.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2773500" class="thewords">The scariest thing I&#x27;ve seen is teenagers on skateboards going down North Avenue while texting.  If I was their mama, ooh, you know&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2782100" class="thewords">It’s terrifying.  So what we&#x27;ve done, we have four parking spaces off&#x2d;street for our duplex.  We&#x27;ve taken out the lilac bushes.  We back into our parking spaces.  We&#x27;re trying not to hit the children.  We&#x27;re trying not to hit the people getting off the bus.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2799200" class="thewords">And I will be inconvenienced if you take away the street parking, but that&#x27;s okay with me. I would prefer to see the children, the bikers, the runners, the joggers, who jog in the street because the sidewalks are so crooked, you know, and they have puddles in them.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2817300" class="thewords">They jog in the road all winter long.  I would prefer to see them safe.  And I will give up my parking.  I would ask you, if you come up with an alternative parking area, we&#x27;d love it, love to know where it is.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2827900" class="thewords">Does that mean I&#x27;m done&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2828500" class="thewords">No.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Soufin</span><span><a data-m="2828700" class="thewords">Okay.  The other thing is I&#x27;ve noticed that North Avenue Alliance Church and the Elks both have large parking areas.  They take care of their constituencies.  They have green spaces.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2839500" class="thewords">Most of my neighbors have driveways and green space, and they don&#x27;t park in the street.  Between the &#x5b;inner belt&#x5d; and the big rock wall that goes to the high school, I can see the whole two&#x2d;block area.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2852500" class="thewords">In the last month, one car has been parked on the street consistently.  One.  In the whole area.  Unless the high school has an event.  Then we have overflow parking.  You have to think about something to do with that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2864600" class="thewords">But like I said, I&#x27;ll be inconvenienced.  Please take away our parking and make the street safe.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2871300" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thank you all.  We really appreciate that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2878200" class="thewords">And I&#x27;ll just remind everybody again that the yellow light comes on when it’s time to wrap up your comments.  The red light comes on when it’s time to stop.  Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Eames</span><span><a data-m="2887400" class="thewords">Good evening.  Thank you, council, for giving me an opportunity to speak.  My name is Glen Eames.  I&#x27;m a resident of Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2894700" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve lived here for almost 30 years, and for 29 of those years we&#x27;ve been trying to address some of these issues.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2903700" class="thewords">I urge you to accept the North Ave. proposal as written, and not with the amendments.  This is a major corridor into the city, and we&#x27;ve recently gone on to a &#x22;Go For Gold&#x22; campaign in the city, where we&#x27;re trying to improve transportation.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2923000" class="thewords">One of the goals is to improve all of the entrance corridors to our city.  I think that North Avenue as a main artery into the city is ripe for this sort of project.  People are going to be on North Avenue, and they are on North Avenue now, on bicycles.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2948300" class="thewords">So I urge you to accommodate all forms of transportation here.  I&#x27;m a motorist.  I own two automobiles.  And I&#x27;m also a cyclist.  Most people look at me and know me from cycling, but I drive quite a bit in the city too.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2964400" class="thewords">I can certainly appreciate the problems that one of the former speakers spoke of, of bumper to bumper traffic, and I really feel as though this could be part of the solution the problems of North Avenue, allowing people a safer place to ride.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="2982300" class="thewords">So I really urge you at this point to approve the project as&#x2d;is without the amendments.  Thanks for giving me a chance to speak.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="2990100" class="thewords">Thank you.  John &#x5b;Blakeney&#x5d;, followed by &#x5b;Shanta&#x5d; Eastman.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3006600" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Blakeney</span><span><a data-m="3007200" class="thewords">Hi, council.  Thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak.  My name is Ian Blakeney, I live in Ward Four.  This is my wife, Shanta.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Eastman</span><span><a data-m="3014100" class="thewords">We live on Apple Tree Point Road.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Blakeney</span><span><a data-m="3017600" class="thewords">Ward Four.  I really want to urge the council to pass the North Avenue Corridor Study, or Plan, as&#x2d;is without the amendments.  I am a, we&#x27;re a one&#x2d;car family.  We both bike all over Burlington, downtown, around the New North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3032100" class="thewords">And frankly, it’s really not that safe to bike on North Avenue, although I do it.  I&#x27;ve had a few close calls myself.  And the bike path, we&#x27;ve talked about some of the drawbacks to the bike path at night, and in the winter.  And more importantly, I&#x27;m also a teacher, I teach in the Burlington schools, and I&#x27;m thinking about the kids in the New North... Well, the kids all over Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3051800" class="thewords">I really wouldn&#x27;t feel safe letting my children ride their bikes on North Avenue right now.  My kids are going to be going to Hunt and to Burlington High School.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3058200" class="thewords">I want them to be able to get to school on their bicycles, and to their friends&#x27; house, and when they want to go out and have fun and go to the parks.  Right now that&#x27;s really not an option.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3066200" class="thewords">So I really urge you to allow the protected bike lanes to be installed in the pilot project, and allow all the kids in Burlington, and the parents, to feel safe with their kids riding on the streets.  Do you want to add anything&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Eastman</span><span><a data-m="3080300" class="thewords">Well, I just know that we&#x27;re some of the few year&#x2d;round bikers that we know.  A lot of our friends would be bikers, but — and they think we&#x27;re kind of crazy, because when we bike on the avenue, there&#x27;s no shoulder in the winter, &#x27;cause there&#x27;s so much snow piled up.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3101000" class="thewords">You know, the roads are more narrow in the winter.  So I would just, I think many more people... If we&#x27;re moving toward a greener economy and thinking about my kids&#x27; future, we need to encourage bicycling as much as we possibly can, and make it more comfortable for parents and families.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Blakeney</span><span><a data-m="3121800" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3122200" class="thewords">Thank you.  Mrs. Blakeney, could you give us your name&#x3f;  Because we only have Ian —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Eastman</span><span><a data-m="3125700" class="thewords">Oh, it’s Shanta Eastman.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3126900" class="thewords">Shanta Eastman.  Oh, you&#x27;re the next...&#x3f;  Oh.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3134200" class="thewords">Jason &#x5b;von Dreische&#x5d; followed by Connie Pressman.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">von Dreische</span><span><a data-m="3146900" class="thewords">Thank you, President Shannon.  I&#x27;m here speaking for Local Motion tonight.  Thank you for consideration of tonight&#x27;s resolution that outlines a series of common sense changes to North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3159900" class="thewords">Taken together, these improvements will make Burlington&#x27;s longest street work better for everyone, whether you&#x27;re walking, biking, driving or taking the bus.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3169100" class="thewords">As you&#x27;ve heard tonight, there&#x27;s strong support across the community as a whole, and in the New North End in particular, for a safer, more orderly design for North Avenue.  One that discourages excessive speed, makes it easier to cross the street on foot, reduces the risk of being rear&#x2d;ended when you&#x27;re waiting to make a turn, and provides separated and protected space for bikes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3191500" class="thewords">Local Motion applauds the hard work and the dedication of the North Avenue Advisory Committee that laid the foundation for this change, of the city staff that mapped out what it would take to make that change happen, and of the TEUC for endorsing that vision for change as the desired direction for our city.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3208600" class="thewords">We call on the city council to adopt the resolution as presented.  It’s an excellent plan.  Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t applaud the amendments as presented to the council.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3217900" class="thewords">In particular, we&#x27;d like to call your attention to one specific impact of Councilor Ayres&#x27;s amendment — the fact that it strips from the resolution any mention of protected bike lanes.  In a city that&#x27;s committed to equity, to quality of life, and to active transportation, this is really unfortunate.  Communities of all kinds are installing protected bike lanes with a barrier between cars and bikes, because they make it safer for kids, seniors, new bike riders, and all kinds of people to ride a bike.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3247500" class="thewords">And the truth is Burlington&#x27;s falling behind when it comes to making it safe and easy for everyone to walk and bike.  The inclusion of protected bike lanes in the pilot was a solid first step in reversing that trend.  I urge you in the strongest possible terms to include a protected bike lane in the pilot by any procedural measure that you deem appropriate.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3266100" class="thewords">Thank you.  Well&#x2d;timed.  And thank you all.  Connie Pressman, followed by Janet Paterson.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3283100" class="thewords">Janet Paterson.  If Connie comes back, let me know.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3290100" class="thewords">And followed by Arthur &#x5b;Vento&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Paterson</span><span><a data-m="3293700" class="thewords">My name&#x27;s Janet Paterson.  I live at 24 Bennington Court, and that&#x27;s right off of Saratoga and right off North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3303500" class="thewords">I&#x27;m a so&#x2d;called senior citizen who have  been living in Burlington in the New North End about 40 years.  I&#x27;ve been driving the 40 years, but have also enjoyed bicycling.   But I refuse to bicycle on North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3318100" class="thewords">I have two neighbors who ride bicycles, and one reads books to the people in the residence area, and she rides on the sidewalk to get to Reading For Seniors.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3334400" class="thewords">I really want to thank you all for putting together the pilot study.  It will make North Avenue much better.  And I have two major concerns.  One is safe way for seniors to get across.  Much like the Pine Street.  Because there&#x27;s places right there in the Thayer House that they&#x27;re long stretches that you can&#x27;t get across the street.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3359300" class="thewords">So having those yellow flashing lights would be really great, because it gives you time to get across.  Secondly, I have a concern about protected bicycle paths.  If I&#x27;m going to ride the bicycle in the new plan, I want some of those orange stakes protecting me along the way.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3379500" class="thewords">I think that amendment calls that they wouldn&#x27;t be there.  And the other thing is the pilot study should be just continued.  I don&#x27;t think we need any more input.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3391100" class="thewords">The people who put the program together have worked long and hard in this plan, and it’s the best thing for New North End.  Thank you very much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3399900" class="thewords">Thank you.  Arthur Vento followed by Liam Griffin.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Vento</span><span><a data-m="3413900" class="thewords">Hello, again.  Nice to see you.  My name is Arthur Vento.  I live on Dodds Court in the New North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3420600" class="thewords">First, I find it really interesting that there are three helmets to advertise part of your bias for your own plan.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3431800" class="thewords">Mr. Vento, could you speak more directly into the microphone&#x3f;  &#x27;Cause Channel 17 will pick it up better.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Vento</span><span><a data-m="3435100" class="thewords">Oh, well, that&#x27;s great.  Okay.  I find it interesting that I see three helmets from council members, showing bias for your own plan.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3443400" class="thewords">That I find offensive right at the start.  And there&#x27;s all kinds of stuff I could talk about.  I could talk about, I see one bicycle every once in a great while that actually obeys the rules of the road.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3455500" class="thewords">I see a pedestrian from time to time that obeys the rules of the road.  You want to change things for 100&#x25; of the people who live in Burlington for less than five percent of the people who live in Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3469500" class="thewords">What I really want to address is, I don&#x27;t believe there has been any public input about doing away with the parking spaces from St. Mark&#x27;s Church to Burlington High School.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3479000" class="thewords">And with no public input about that, you have no right to do anything.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3485600" class="thewords">Your plan is already dead in the water.  Until you discuss it with me — I&#x27;m a part of the public — and with the rest of the people in the public, you can&#x27;t go forward.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3498900" class="thewords">Really simple, really straight&#x2d;forward.  You&#x27;ve got a great plan, except you didn’t lay the groundwork for it.  And by the way, if anybody wanted you riding on that bike path in the winter, it would be passable in the winter.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3512200" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Griffin</span><span><a data-m="3526400" class="thewords">All righty.  My name&#x27;s Liam Griffin, I live in Ward Seven.  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak tonight.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3532700" class="thewords">One of the amendments proposed this evening adds back&#x2d;in parking along one side of North Ave., as referenced by a few previous people,</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3539900" class="thewords">between 127 and Institute and Shore Road and Plattsburgh Ave.  I&#x27;ve been helping survey parking in both those areas over the past few months, and I have a copy of a report that I would like entered into the public record that contains photos and data on both those areas.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3554500" class="thewords">The average number of cars parked between Institute and 127 on average is less than one car, as noted.  Why would we add back&#x2d;in parking and eliminate protected bike lanes in this section so one person can park in the street instead of in their driveway&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3567800" class="thewords">There&#x27;s plenty of off&#x2d;street parking in that segment, and the protected bike lanes proposed there would provide the safest access to the high school.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3574800" class="thewords">The average number of cars parked between Shore Road and Plattsburgh Ave. is also less than one, with the exception of parking counts done church services at St. Mark&#x27;s.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3583900" class="thewords">On average, 15 cars park on North Ave. during church.  That said, at the same time there are an average of 10&#x2d;12 empty spots in the church parking lot, another five spots in the church driveway, and room for many additional cars on Shore Road and other side streets.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3599000" class="thewords">Why would we eliminate the buffered bike lanes through this section so a small number of people can park in front of the church for a few hours on weekends when there is so much unused parking lot behind the church in their own lot&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3612000" class="thewords">North Ave. is a public street, not a private parking lot, last time I checked.  So much of this discussion always seems to come back to a basic fear of change.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3621800" class="thewords">People feel comfortable with the status quo and it can be really difficult for people to imagine how a change that might inconvenience them a little bit personally could also be game&#x2d;changing in a really positive way for the broader community.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3634300" class="thewords">I strongly suggest you reject this amendment, look at the flawed logic of what is being presented.  And it seems like we&#x27;re making a lot of compromises on a great plan that works for everybody who uses North Ave. for transportation, for the sake of a few people who insist that it needs to be used as a parking lot. &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3651100" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thank you.  Jeff Comstock, followed by Tad Cook. Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Comstock</span><span><a data-m="3656700" class="thewords">Yes.  Good evening.  Jeff Comstock, Ward Seven.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3660000" class="thewords">I want to focus my comments on the idea that just because you can doesn’t make it a good idea.  In this case I&#x27;m talking about the &#x22;bicycles may use full lane&#x22; rule currently in effect on city streets.  For example, just because you can ride your bicycle down the middle of North Avenue during rush hour traffic doesn’t make it a good idea.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3683300" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve wanted to share these comments with the council for a long time, but now that the North Avenue Corridor Study is on the agenda, my request is even more urgent.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3693500" class="thewords">As the redesign of North Avenue becomes a reality, I&#x27;m asking the council and the Transportation, Energy and Utilities Committee to eliminate the &#x22;bicycles may use full lane rule.&#x22;  I too am a runner and a cyclist.  I support the principle of &#x22;share the road.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3710900" class="thewords">However, I don&#x27;t have respect for strident bike riders who obstruct traffic just because they&#x27;re entitled to.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3719400" class="thewords">If Burlington really wants to promote itself as a bicycle&#x2d;friendly city through the Complete Streets model, then it must make a real commitment to create bike lanes and not aggravate the conflict between bike and auto traffic.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3732900" class="thewords">The &#x22;bicycles may use full lane&#x22; concept is a failed policy.  In fact, I consider it an abdication of the city&#x27;s public safety responsibility.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3742400" class="thewords">Rather than create a bicycle&#x2d;friendly city, it has created bike chaos and is fostering a self&#x2d;entitled, irresponsible bike culture.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3754100" class="thewords">For one, I&#x27;m neither foolish enough or selfish enough to ride my bike down the middle of North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3759300" class="thewords">Those who do are a traffic hazard, and a threat to their own personal safety.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3764200" class="thewords">I also believe the current emerging biking culture in Burlington — and that&#x27;s not a compliment — should anger quality, responsible cyclists because they too will suffer the consequences of deteriorating driver sentiment.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3779900" class="thewords">It’s time for the cycling community to protect its own reputation and not frame this as only a car versus bicycle debate. &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3789000" class="thewords">So please, now is the time to eliminate &#x22;bicycles may use the full lane&#x22; concept from —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3794500" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Comstock</span><span><a data-m="3794900" class="thewords">— Burlington&#x27;s transportation playbook.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3797900" class="thewords">Thank you.  Tad Cook followed by Steve Norman.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3807700" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Cook</span><span><a data-m="3808400" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thanks for the chance to speak.  I joined the North Avenue Steering Committee 18 months ago, representing Ward Three.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3817700" class="thewords">I previously had worked on North Ave. and I biked between Ward Three, down North Ave. to Institute every day.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3825700" class="thewords">And so I joined because I personally was concerned about what the experience is like between those two points, and along the rest of North Ave.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3833600" class="thewords">And so during the steering committee process, I both biked and drove through the winter, and when it was warmer, to the meetings over the last 18 months.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3843800" class="thewords">And I would urge the council and ask you to support the amendment, or the proposal as&#x2d;is, and not with the proposed amendments.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3853200" class="thewords">It’s a plan that represents a lot of work by members of the community and by staff in the city, and by great consultants.  And I think it represents a vision for North Ave. that can be replicated across Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3869400" class="thewords">And if we don&#x27;t put out a vision now that is the best possible scenario, then we&#x27;re never going to get there down the road.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3877200" class="thewords">You have to start with a big vision and then make it realistic from there.  So thank you, I appreciate the chance to speak, and I appreciate the chance to serve on the committee, and thanks for your consideration.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="3889200" class="thewords">Thank you.  Steve Norman followed by Phil &#x5b;Hammersaw&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Norman</span><span><a data-m="3896600" class="thewords">Hi, I&#x27;m Steve Norman, and I live just off of North Avenue on Staniford Road between North Avenue and the bike path.  In the year 2000, with much advanced deliberation, the city adopted its legacy plan, which looked ahead 30 years., and envisioned a city of perhaps as many as 65,000 people, believe it or not.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3918500" class="thewords">It’s good to be ambitious, I guess, but we are growing already.  We&#x27;re not there yet, but we&#x27;re growing, and the North End is growing.  And our visitors are growing.  And anyone who thinks we&#x27;re going to maintain past speeds of car travel while we grow larger, perhaps hasn’t been driving anywhere else but here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3939200" class="thewords">&#x5b;laughter&#x5d; That&#x27;s not what we learned from the 20th century.  It doesn’t happen that way.  To the contrary, our own public policy has already wisely shifted away from higher car speeds to other options — more public transportation, more active transportation, and infrastructure, to empower those choices.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3958900" class="thewords">Complete Streets is the law.  Act 250 was amended this year to lower the minimum traffic flows through the downtowns in Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3967900" class="thewords">Transportation planners are expanding our bus routes, and commuters are taking advantage of those routes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3974300" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve lived just off of North Avenue for 25 years.  It’s taken me most of that time to calm myself down and my driving habits to meet the 30 mile an hour speed limit.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="3986900" class="thewords">But I do, and most others fly past me on one side or the other, depending on which lane I&#x27;m in in that part of the street, because it was designed and built for 40 mile an hour speeds, and people tend to go what feels right on the highway.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4001900" class="thewords">So that was a mistake.  Remember the interstate&#x2d;type overhead signs we used to have at the beltline interchange&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4008700" class="thewords">Those came down.  We really don&#x27;t want our neighborhood to look like exit 14 and to grow like that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4016500" class="thewords">Four&#x2d;to&#x2d;three&#x2d;lane diets do work on Colchester Avenue and Williston Road. &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4024600" class="thewords">They work fine.  Use that lane for your left&#x2d;hand turn and to pass the bus, and we&#x27;ll all be safer.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4029700" class="thewords">Thank you.  Phil Hammersaw, followed by Susan &#x5b;Moncrese&#x5d;.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Hammersaw</span><span><a data-m="4040200" class="thewords">Thank you.  I want to speak in favor of not adopting the amendments, but taking the recommendations that were worked so hard on by our citizens, DPW, the TEUC, all of us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4057600" class="thewords">And I want to see that recommended.  And I&#x27;ll start off by saying it’s the economy, stupid.  This is not a war between bikes and cars, pedestrians and buses.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4069300" class="thewords">This is about real estate.  North Avenue is real estate.  And as real estate, it predominantly is designed for cars.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4078400" class="thewords">That&#x27;s not its highest and best use.  Its highest and best use is for multiple modes of transportation.  Bikes, cars, walkers, public transportation, which is essential.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4093000" class="thewords">And when this is done in cities all over the United States and the world, what happens is real estate value increases, residential and commercial.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4103900" class="thewords">Who has ever seen an ad that says, &#x22;House for sale, close to the bike path and close to public transportation, not close to the main road&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4114300" class="thewords">When this is done in areas, corridors, when we add bike paths and we add good pedestrian walkways, businesses increase in that zone by 40&#x2d;60&#x25;.  That&#x27;s money in the local economy.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4128900" class="thewords">Every dollar gained in the local economy generates seven dollars more for the whole community.  When we go out to the box stores, what happens is you get five percent return on a dollar.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4142800" class="thewords">It’s the economy, stupid.  What’s going to make Burlington grow, what’s bringing us to the 21st century, is not a fight about narrowing the roads or streets.  It’s about facing reality, it’s a changing world, we need to do it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4157300" class="thewords">These bike lanes and pedestrian walkways are essential to the growth of the community.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4164100" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Susan Monkrese, followed by Matthew &#x5b;Tchabat&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Monkrese</span><span><a data-m="4172100" class="thewords">Good evening.  I&#x27;m Susan Monkrese.  I am a mom and a bicyclist, and I live in the South End of Burlington.  I would like to urge the council to support the resolution un&#x2d;amended.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4183800" class="thewords">On the issue of protected bike lanes, I&#x27;m a mom who listens to all the other moms at school saying they wish they could pick their kids up by bike or on foot.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4194200" class="thewords">And they do not feel able to ride to schools and take their kids to and from school.  Protected bike lanes make a major difference in the safety of children.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4204000" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve been a bike commuter for 20 years, and I&#x27;m willing to take risks for myself, but I will not take risks for my children that they have no say over.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4211900" class="thewords">They&#x27;ll get to make their own risky decisions come 13 or 14.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4217100" class="thewords">I would also like to speak to the issue of an amendment which appears to privilege the opinions of people in the New North End over others in determining the future of the pilot study.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4228400" class="thewords">As I understand it, streets are public, and as a taxpayer I want access to the high school that I hope my daughter will ride to on a bicycle, and I hope that we would recognize that these are a shared resource that belong to all of us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4243300" class="thewords">This point came home to me very forcefully in the last time I spoke in front of a body here in Burlington, which was the parks commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4250200" class="thewords">I was active in establishing a new community garden.  We held outreach forums, we did neighborhood discussions, we had groups of neighborhoods from surrounding the garden.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4260600" class="thewords">And at one of those open forums, someone stood up and yelled at me that this garden was being rammed down their throats, that there was no opportunity for feedback, and it was a done deal.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4270800" class="thewords">And at that point I luckily remembered that community gardens have been approved by the city council, where appropriate, as a use on city land, and so I informed this person that community gardens are an allowed and approved use of city park land when they are deemed appropriate.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4289100" class="thewords">My understanding is that bike lanes &#x5b;beep&#x5d; are part of Complete Streets, and therefore are an approved use, and I&#x27;d like to see them treated as such.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4295800" class="thewords">Thank you.  Matthew Tchabat, followed by John &#x5b;Halvey&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Chabot</span><span><a data-m="4306400" class="thewords">Thank you.  Good evening.  My name is Matthew Chabot, I&#x27;m the general manager of Burlington Town Center.  I am also a member of the Church Street Marketplace Commission.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4314300" class="thewords">I&#x27;m here this evening to voice my support for the relocation of the CCTA bus station from its current location at Church and Cherry over to St. Paul and request that the city council provide the easement that&#x27;ll allow that to take place.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4330300" class="thewords">Over two years ago I was approached by the CCTA regarding different proposed alternatives to its current location, and we did feel strongly and continue to feel strongly that maintaining the bus hub in the downtown corridor, with a close proximity to Church Street, does serve the best needs of all involved — certainly those that utilize the services in the downtown corridor, and the bus station as well.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4361200" class="thewords">Church and Cherry does create a chokepoint for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic based on the location of the current bus station.  And again, I would just simply ask that the city council grant the easement request of the CCTA.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4378700" class="thewords">Thank you, Mr. Chabot.  Councilor Blais, you are the keeper of silent consonants.  I hope you&#x27;ll remind me next time.</a></span></p>

And my hat&#x27;s off to everybody that&#x27;s worked on this project.  I know there&#x27;s a lotta people involved in it.  I&#x27;ve been reading about it on the Front Porch Forum for quite some time.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4415200" class="thewords">Cars and bikes don&#x27;t mix physically.  There&#x27;s danger involved.  And I don&#x27;t have any children, but I&#x27;d be really scared if they went on the avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4425000" class="thewords">I would recommend they grow up learning how to ride on the bike path.  The bike path is beautiful, something we should all be proud of.  It brings a lot of tourists to the area.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4434600" class="thewords">We have a couple of bike paths.  We have the one to the Intervale as well as the one on the lake.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4444900" class="thewords">If you enter North Avenue from the north, Plattsburg Avenue, and there&#x27;s a bicycle on your right, and you want to take a right on Tracy Drive, we signal our — I&#x27;m driving a car, the bike&#x27;s on the right — I signal to turn a right on Tracy Drive, the bike wants to pass me on the right at the same time.

    <p><span><a data-m="4465600" class="thewords">I have poor peripheral vision, might be a touch of glaucoma.  Can&#x27;t see the bike.  Keep it in mind.  We&#x27;ve got 65 aprons and entrances between 127 and Shore Road.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4478700" class="thewords">65 aprons &#x5b;unintelligible&#x5d;.  Can&#x27;t see the bike passing on the right, okay&#x3f;  So you got one lane of cars, there&#x27;s no way for the right&#x2d;hand turn people to slow down.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4490500" class="thewords">If you&#x27;re taking a right&#x2d;hand turn, the bike&#x27;s passing you on the right.  It’s scary.  The center left lane — you go down the Williston Road, you&#x27;re going to the airport, get in the center left lane to take a left to the airport, the shortcut road — I don&#x27;t know the name of it, everyone knows it’s there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4505500" class="thewords">The same time, a car coming towards Burlington, headed west, wants to turn left.  We&#x27;re playing chicken in the center left lane.  Who was there first&#x3f;  No, I just bailed out, get to the right... &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ellis</span><span><a data-m="4556300" class="thewords">Well, there is something familiar about sitting here, I&#x27;ll have to admit that.  Thank you.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4560800" class="thewords">Good to see you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ellis</span><span><a data-m="4561600" class="thewords">You know, I&#x27;ve lived here — Nancy and I have lived in Ward Four for 45 years, and it’s always been a neighborhood to me.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4571500" class="thewords">We raised four children here.  We were fortunate enough to have some of those children grow up and then move into Ward Four themselves and raise their own children.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4580800" class="thewords">So we&#x27;ve had the benefit of children and grandchildren, and it’s been fun.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4585700" class="thewords">Ward Four to me is a neighborhood.  And when I think of a neighborhood, what I think of — I made a little list here — I think of bicycles, I think of children, I think of senior citizens — a strange thing that happens to middle&#x2d;aged people &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;,</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4603400" class="thewords">I think of parks, and we have many of them, or several of them, anyhow, in the New North End.  And they&#x27;re on both sides of North Avenue, so that half the people, to get to one set of parks, has to cross.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4619400" class="thewords">And the other half has to cross this way if they want to get to those parks.  So the parks are there, but there is North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4631300" class="thewords">I think of skateboarding, and I&#x27;ve seen my kids do that.  I think of front yard soccer, another thing, and the ball frequently goes off the yard, into the road.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4646300" class="thewords">I think that of all the things that they do, and they go to school.  And I just checked some of the data on schools.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4653900" class="thewords">You know, we have four schools, three schools.  These are grade schools, first through eighth grade.  C.P. Smith, Flynn and Hunt.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4665000" class="thewords">Together, those three schools have about 1,000 students in them.  And they serve both sides of North Avenue. &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4678500" class="thewords">I know you&#x27;re not accustomed to having the timer on you, are you, Councilor Ellis&#x3f; &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ellis</span><span><a data-m="4681100" class="thewords">Yeah, I&#x27;ve got about 15 more minutes.  But anyhow, they all have to cross.  And I think that&#x27;s a shame.  I&#x27;m in favor of the motion that&#x27;s put forward.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4690000" class="thewords">I&#x27;m not in favor of the amendments.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4693000" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4695900" class="thewords">Nathaniel Burns followed by Don McDonald.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Burns</span><span><a data-m="4705800" class="thewords">Hello, councilors, my name is Nathaniel Burns.  I&#x27;m a resident of the New North End, specifically on North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4713600" class="thewords">And I&#x27;m in support of this thing that&#x27;s in front of us, with any amendments.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4722300" class="thewords">And I&#x27;d like to speak about those amendments.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4725100" class="thewords">To sum up one amendment, it says basically if public input from the New North End does not support its continuation, the city will restore the 4&#x2d;3&#x2d;lane pilot area to its current configuration.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4738900" class="thewords">And I assume that is taking into consideration the people who live in that region and what they want, because they have to live there and deal with it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4749000" class="thewords">So I also assume that if we&#x27;re going to have that in there, maybe we could add another amendment, a little bit of pork, and say that after the F&#x2d;35s are put at the airport, everybody who lives over there in that area, after a few months, can decide whether or not they want to keep them.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4768800" class="thewords">And if they decide against it, then we&#x27;ll just take them outta there.  Obviously, I&#x27;m kidding.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4775600" class="thewords">My logic is flawed, and so is this amendment. &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4780800" class="thewords">The second amendment I&#x27;d like to speak about is about between Institute Road and Vermont 127, is what I know best — that&#x27;s closer to me.  I don&#x27;t know as much about further north on North Ave.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4792800" class="thewords">But I go past there all the time in a car and on a bike, and I rarely see cars parked there.  A few here and there.  That&#x27;s right north of the high school.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4803000" class="thewords">And I looked on Zillow the other day at the size of the lots there, and they&#x27;re pretty big lots.  They&#x27;re like quarter acre, half acre.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4812900" class="thewords">There&#x27;s only a couple that are multi&#x2d;unit, and so I don&#x27;t know why they need all that parking on the street for their personal use.  We&#x27;re not talking about apartment complexes that have no parking lot for them to park all the people who live there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4826100" class="thewords">So I don&#x27;t support that amendment either.  And I also want to thank everybody for all the time you put in, for everything you do to make this city so great, and we appreciate it.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="4836000" class="thewords">Thank you.  Thank you.</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="4917100" class="thewords">We need this terminal, we need it now.  Thank you.</a></span></p>

    <p><span><a data-m="4935700" class="thewords">I am a father of three, and our entire family uses both vehicles, buses and bikes to get to school, to get to work and to do local shopping.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4950700" class="thewords">I just want to say that a lot of people have mentioned safety issues on North Avenue.  I have many experiences on North Avenue that would corroborate some of the concerns that they have.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4960900" class="thewords">I think that it’s imperative for the New North End to open the corridor to people who are on bicycles, and I think that there are substantial economic possibilities that would happen if that were to go forward.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4974800" class="thewords">So I want to say I support the vision for a Complete Street on North Avenue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="4980900" class="thewords">I also support the North Avenue Corridor as&#x2d;is, the pilot project as&#x2d;is with any amendments.  In addition to that, I have to say that while we also use the 127 bike path and the waterfront bike path occasionally to come into town, more for recreational purposes, both of those, as has been said, are not plowed in the winter, and also they are not lighted at night.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5007900" class="thewords">We are a one&#x2d;car family, and we cannot afford another car.  So the bicycles and the buses are the ways we get into town.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5016100" class="thewords">If that car&#x27;s going somewhere else.  Thank you very much for your time.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5020100" class="thewords">Thank you.  Tom Morley, followed by Robert &#x5b;Herandine&#x5d;.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Morley</span><span><a data-m="5028600" class="thewords">Hi.  My name is Tom Morley.  I live just off Ethan Allen Parkway.  I drive on North Avenue almost every day.  I&#x27;m an avid biker.  I do use the bike paths, but they&#x27;re crowded or not lit or not plowed.  The Intervale&#x27;s got a fairly nasty hill at the end of it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5049800" class="thewords">It’s not really a practical means of getting into town.  And if I want to go to the shopping center or I want to go down to Battery Park, that&#x27;s not a practical way to get there.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5064100" class="thewords">I agree with the person who said in another meeting that while I&#x27;m driving, I hate the bikers, and while I&#x27;m biking, I hate the drivers. &#x5b;laughter&#x5d; Because we&#x27;re all thrown in the same street and we sort of make up our own rules.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5078700" class="thewords">I note the person who said, who mentioned the &#x22;bikers may take the whole lane&#x22;, and when I use North Avenue, yeah, I&#x27;m an experienced biker, I take the lane, I pedal like hell so I don&#x27;t hold up too many people behind me.  As I&#x27;m going north on 127, I suddenly find people on my right, merging at high speed.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5104400" class="thewords">So you&#x27;re sorta taking your life in your hands there.  And I will not go to the shopping center, which is about three&#x2d;quarters of a mile from my house, because you have to make a left turn, which is just clearly dangerous.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5120300" class="thewords">Or you can go up on the sidewalks, and if there&#x27;s people on the sidewalks, the sidewalks are in poor shape and narrow, so there&#x27;s really no way to get to the shopping center.  And I would be doing a heck of a lot more errands there if there was a discrete bike path.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5137800" class="thewords">So I like the idea of taking the four lanes and going to three.  I think that&#x27;s a proven design.  We&#x27;ve got a lot of experience with that.  &#x5b;beep&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5149700" class="thewords">It’s simple.  And for that reason, I urge the council to adopt the recommendations without the amendments, as stated.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5159400" class="thewords">Thank you.  Robert Herandine &#x5b;clears throat&#x5d;, followed by Nancy Berger.</a></span></p>

I&#x27;m over 70, and I&#x27;m a year&#x2d;round bicyclist.  Since I&#x27;ve come to Burlington eight years ago I estimate I&#x27;ve biked to downtown from the North End 800 to 1,000 times, year&#x2d;round.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5191500" class="thewords">I support the proposed pilot.  I do not support the amendments because I think each one kills off an important part of a reasonable test.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5203600" class="thewords">If we put those amendments in, the test will be a weak test.  The first one is the separation of bicyclists and cars.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5212800" class="thewords">Vermonters aren&#x27;t afraid of the cold and dark, but they are afraid about being run over by a Mack truck.  Therefore, we must have separation, or the test is weak.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5224700" class="thewords">Second, we need a test that runs year&#x2d;round.  When people talk about how much fun it is to bicycle, they show a picture of somebody going along in a tank top and shorts in July, but as a year&#x2d;rounder I also know what it feels like at 5pm in February.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5239100" class="thewords">We need a test that runs throughout the entire year.  If the amendment allows us to cut the test off after just a few months, we don&#x27;t do that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5247200" class="thewords">Therefore, I do not support either amendment, but I do support the pilot.  Thank you.</a></span></p>

I&#x27;m a cyclist, and I&#x27;m a runner and a pedestrian.

    <p><span><a data-m="5281300" class="thewords">But I&#x27;ve heard a lot of eloquence here tonight, and a lot of reason.  And I&#x27;ve changed my mind.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Fry</span><span><a data-m="5299100" class="thewords">Good evening.  Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.  I just came to speak in favor of the North Avenue Corridor Plan.  I think it’s well thought out.  It’s been well&#x2d;planned, and I think it’ll work.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5315400" class="thewords">One only needs to drive on North Avenue once or twice and encounter a bicycle or a pedestrian crossing the road at the wrong place to understand that there&#x27;s two issues involved here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5327900" class="thewords">And I think the main issue is public safety.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5333200" class="thewords">I actually have been to the website where the plans have been laid out, and I&#x27;ve studied them, I&#x27;ve looked at &#x27;em. I&#x27;m in favor of the three&#x2d;lane and the two&#x2d;bike lane plan.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5346500" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve also, on Channel 17, watched the NPA wards four and seven proposal of the plan, and I listened to it carefully.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5360600" class="thewords">I don&#x27;t know how many people are aware that over the last four years there have been 76 car crashes on North Avenue.  76.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5368100" class="thewords">It seems excessive to me.  I&#x27;m not an expert, but it seems a lot.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5374700" class="thewords">The other issue is quality of life.  I don&#x27;t know if you notice that when a street is paved or a sidewalk is improved or new curbing comes in, people try to kind of improve their property, they mow the lawn a little bit more, they might, you know, grow some flowers, try to make their property look better.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5403000" class="thewords">You know, an upgrade on North Avenue is just going to make our neighborhood look more attractive.  And I think it’s going to attract more commerce to the area.  And I think that the North Avenue has been stagnant for a long time, and it needs to kind of walk into the 21st &#x5b;beep&#x5d; century.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5421900" class="thewords">If I&#x27;m allowed, I&#x27;ll just say one more thing.  I&#x27;m getting a little tired of hearing the drumbeat of negativity that comes out of the New North End.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5431400" class="thewords">I don&#x27;t think it’s representative of most residents.</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="overidecolr">Hallway</span><span><a data-m="5481500" class="thewords">Oh, I&#x27;ll try not to take it.  As a representative on the Corridor Study Committee over the last 18 months, I&#x27;ve heard a lot of these comments, and I hope that you guys listen to them carefully.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5498500" class="thewords">I think that the plan that is out there is a good one.  Of course, as we, you know, you might think... But it really did weigh on, put into consideration as many of the comments as possible.  It’s hard to get something that&#x27;s perfect.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5516400" class="thewords">For that reason, I&#x27;m very supportive of doing the pilot.  I think that&#x27;s the way to take it from an academic process to a reality, doing it cautiously to be sure that we do it right.  There&#x27;s time to make the New North End even more of a sense of community, and having it a race track doesn’t really do that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5540200" class="thewords">So I do also want to say that I&#x27;m not in support of all the amendments, but I do think that it’s a good idea that an ad hoc committee be paying attention during the pilot study.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5555600" class="thewords">So I think that&#x27;s a good idea that there is one.  I understand that&#x27;s part of the thought.  I think the parking, especially at St. Mark&#x27;s and a few other places, there wasn&#x27;t enough discussion to necessarily put that in the pilot study now.  So I support kind of leaving that alone.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5578400" class="thewords">And again, I really applaud this community for engaging so spiritedly.  And lastly, I agree with what the last gentleman said.  The negativity, I&#x27;d like to see it disappear.  I think a lot of people have seen some of that lately, and that&#x27;s not what a good community does.  What we&#x27;re doing here is.  Thanks.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5597100" class="thewords">Thank you. &#x5b;beep&#x5d;  Michael McGargen, followed by Nancy Elis.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5614300" class="thewords">Welcome.  That&#x27;s it.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">McGargen</span><span><a data-m="5616400" class="thewords">Hi.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5619800" class="thewords">So, I just wanted to mention a few things fast here.  Since I had a few pages of quick bullet points here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5630600" class="thewords">So quickly, since I&#x27;ve been on North Avenue, since 1971 — you can do the math — I feel, since I changed from ward four to ward seven, where I&#x27;m living now, I had a vested interest on this North Ave. Corridor study.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5653400" class="thewords">And one is, you know, you can&#x27;t legislate common sense, manners, patience and individual responsibilities.  No matter what you try to do with these plans.  The studies with the roads and the productive things out here.  We have bike paths, we had an original bike path, which was the one that was the train tracks, and then we had the one that was on the other side of 127, which doesn’t get a whole lotta use.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5689100" class="thewords">You know, but to sit there and try to take over lanes of traffic on North Avenue now, we haven&#x27;t seen any discussion and heard any discussion from the fire department and the police department weighed in out of any of these things out here, which is glaringly obvious, silent, whatever you want to say.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5712300" class="thewords">Everybody wants to talk about the merits of the bicycles, but you know, what’s going to happen when somebody wants to say, &#x22;What if I want to ride my horse out here&#x3f;  Where&#x27;s my horse gonna go&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5723600" class="thewords">That hasn’t been discussed yet.  Are we gonna make a special allowance for that&#x3f; &#x5b;beep&#x5d;  Oh geez, that&#x27;s awfully fast.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5731000" class="thewords">You know, there&#x27;s a whole lotta things that can be talked about here, but the right thing to be brought up is there&#x27;s a whole lot of people who want to say they have rights, but there&#x27;s a lotta people like myself that say we have rights, and the city council shouldn’t just be making a decision out here that the voters and the residents of the New North End who are most affected shouldn’t, they should have a say in the process.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5756700" class="thewords">Thank you.  Nancy Ellis, followed by Genevieve Jacobs.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ellis</span><span><a data-m="5767800" class="thewords">My name is Nancy Ellis, and I live on the New North End.  And I want to say I appreciate the many improvements the city has made to accommodate automobile traffic along North Avenue since I first moved to Burlington in 1969.  That&#x27;s 45 years, according to my husband — he does the math.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5790100" class="thewords">One of the major improvements was the Intervale Beltline.  The beltline is an alternative, fast route dedicated to automobiles, with no bikes allowed.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5805600" class="thewords">I&#x27;m a bicyclist, believe it or not, and walker, pedestrian and a driver.  I do support a protected bike lane along North Avenue now, and improvements to the pedestrian traffic access.  I have noticed that the City of Montreal has well used protected bike lanes throughout the city, and those bike lanes don&#x27;t seem to inhibit the flow of traffic there, with a much larger population than Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5840000" class="thewords">So I support the protected bike lane resolution tonight, without the amendments that might dilute the purpose of that resolution.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5853900" class="thewords">Thank you.  Genevieve Jacobs is our last speaker.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5860000" class="thewords">Welcome.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Jacobs</span><span><a data-m="5861600" class="thewords">Thank you so much.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5862600" class="thewords">You get the last word.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Jacobs</span><span><a data-m="5863600" class="thewords">Oh boy, whoo.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5864400" class="thewords">Almost.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Jacobs</span><span><a data-m="5864900" class="thewords">Don&#x27;t know if I can live up to that.  Thank you, everybody —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5868200" class="thewords">Just except us.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Jacobs</span><span><a data-m="5868500" class="thewords">— it’s very impressive to see how involved all of the citizens of Burlington are.  In smooth flow of commerce, traffic, community, thank you to everyone for that.  Bikers, walkers, drivers.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5883900" class="thewords">I&#x27;ve been living on North Champlaign Street since 2001, and on Front Street since 1998.  Raised my son here, used all modes of transportation, plan to continue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5898700" class="thewords">But I had a big surprise — and I&#x27;m sure it’s a surprise to most of you as well — when, in the process of repaving North Champlaign Street, which is also known as Route 127 North, sister to Park Street, 127 South, to discover that the speed bumps which had been four inches high, and 100&#x25; successful in keeping vehicular traffic under 25 miles per hour, had been replaced without any consultation, comment, notice of any kind, to conform to some new federal guideline, to be under two inches.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5943600" class="thewords">They are now speed suggestions, at best.  And so puny as to, why even bother&#x3f;  Now, that is also a protected bike lane, and it seems to me that given the amount of concern and consciousness in this room, somebody made a bad call with that decision, and it is not acceptable.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5968700" class="thewords">It’s going against what everybody has agreed upon we want to see for our city.  So I&#x27;d like to see that rectified as soon as possible, while they&#x27;re still paving.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="5979300" class="thewords">Thank you.  So thank you all for your comments, and for your utterly civil behavior and silent applause.  We really appreciate that.  &#x5b;beep&#x5d; &#x5b;laughter&#x5d; Okay.  Move to adjourn.  &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="5998600" class="thewords">We will now go to our consent agenda, right, Councilor Bushor&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6003100" class="thewords">That&#x27;s correct.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6004700" class="thewords">Councilor Bushor.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="" class="thewords">So I would like to move to adopt the consent agenda and take the actions indicated.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6010000" class="thewords">Seconded by Counselor Ayres.  Any amendments or...&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6018600" class="thewords">Seeing none, all those in favor of adopting the consent agenda and taking the actions indicated, please say aye.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Various</span><span><a data-m="6024700" class="thewords">Aye.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6027300" class="thewords">Any opposed&#x3f;  That&#x27;s unanimous.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6035300" class="thewords">We now have a resolution recognition of John Dewey Day, and annual John Dewey Parade and children&#x27;s event.  Councilor Paul.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Paul</span><span><a data-m="6044700" class="thewords">Thank you, President Shannon.  I&#x27;d like to move this resolution, ask the floor back after a second, and with the council&#x27;s indulgence, would ask for a reading of this resolution by Councilor Blais prior to the vote.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6059800" class="thewords">And is there a second&#x3f;  Councilor Blais.  Councilor Paul&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Paul</span><span><a data-m="6063400" class="thewords">Thank you very much.  This resolution is a recognition of John Dewey, a philosopher and educator who was born in Burlington on October 20th, 1859.  John Dewey was a proud graduate of the University of Vermont, and he had a long career in the philosophy of education, living to the age of 92.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6085900" class="thewords">Professor Dewey was not only an American philosopher, he was a psychologist and an educational reformer whose ideas have been influential in education and in social reform.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6098700" class="thewords">He was a well&#x2d;known public intellectual, and a major voice in progressive education and liberalism.  He was also known for his advocacy for democracy, and he considered the two fundamental elements, schools and civil society, to be major topics needing attention and reconstruction to encourage experimental intelligence and plurality.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6125700" class="thewords">He advocated that complete democracy was to be obtained not just by extending voting rights, and if you&#x27;ll recall when he was talking about this, at least for some point, at that point women did not have the right to vote.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6141000" class="thewords">But he spoke extensively about voting rights, but also about ensuring that there exists to be a well formed public opinion accomplished by effective communication among citizens, experts and politicians, and with the latter, being accountable policies that they adopt.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6163100" class="thewords">I&#x27;m pleased to bring forward this resolution and would ask that Frank Gonzalez, a man who has been instrumental in keeping the heritage of John Dewey alive and well in Burlington, be able to come forward and speak to this resolution, and after his remarks, I would yield the floor to Councilor Blais or whomever you deem.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6185300" class="thewords">If Mr. Gonzalez can be very brief —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Paul</span><span><a data-m="6187400" class="thewords">Yes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6188100" class="thewords">You may come up.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6195100" class="thewords">Welcome, Mr. Gonzalez.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6201000" class="thewords">I&#x27;m here on behalf of the John Dewey committee, and I have to share with you a deep concern that I have.  After having been born here, he was known throughout China, Japan, Europe.  And when I speak to people on the street, &#x22;Are you aware of John Dewey&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6225300" class="thewords">&#x22;Oh yes, the decimal Dewey.&#x22;  No, that&#x27;s Melville Dewey, and he left a legacy.  But John Dewey is known throughout, and if more people could know about his legacy, they would say, &#x22;This is so timely.&#x22;  And we need to beat that creative drum like never before.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6248000" class="thewords">Because we are in a situation now where we need to build community, and understand that each individual is unique.  And that&#x27;s what I learned in the program when I was in a John Dewey program in Pasadena, California for three and a half years, and discovered that he was born here in Burlington, and began to read his works.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6273100" class="thewords">And I realized I owe you, John Dewey.  So on behalf of the John Dewey Committee, we want you all to be aware of his writings as well, and I brought some of his quotes that I would like to pass on to you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6296600" class="thewords">And if I may just read this one, &#x22;In Vermont, perhaps more than elsewhere, there was embodied into the spirit of the people the conviction that governments were like the houses we live in.  Made to contribute to human welfare, and those who lived in them were as free to change and develop the needs of the human family called for such alterations and modifications.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6327800" class="thewords">&#x22;So deeply bred in Vermonters was this conviction that I still think that one is more loyally patriotic to the ideal of America when one maintains this view than when one conceives of patriotism as rigid attachment to a form of the state alleged to be fixed forever.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6349600" class="thewords">&#x22;So that one should heed the claims of a common human society as superior to those of any particular political form.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6363100" class="thewords">So with that, I would like to pass these on to you folks, and share them, please, with your family, your neighbors, and friends.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6376300" class="thewords">And are there any questions about John Dewey&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6382300" class="thewords">Councilors, did you have any questions for Mr. Gonzalez&#x3f;  No&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6388000" class="thewords">I might add one thing.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6389700" class="thewords">Councilor Knodell&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Knodell</span><span><a data-m="6393000" class="thewords">Mr. Gonzalez, are you familiar with the place where John Dewey is buried&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6399700" class="thewords">I&#x27;m sorry, say —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Knodell</span><span><a data-m="6400900" class="thewords">Are you familiar with the place where John Dewey is buried&#x3f;  On the University of Vermont campus.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6410400" class="thewords">Oh, at the University of Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Knodell</span><span><a data-m="6412200" class="thewords">Yes.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6412900" class="thewords">Well, he was born here on Willard Street, and when I walk by there, I always stop and salute.  And when you see the house, you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s — you can&#x27;t see the entrance, but you see a window where the fireplace is, the chimney.  That&#x27;s the room he was born in.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6434700" class="thewords">And the family that owns the house, they&#x27;re very welcoming, and they have allowed us to go in and visit where John Dewey was born.  Very, very touching.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6447600" class="thewords">Thank you.  Councilor Knodell, go ahead.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Knodell</span><span><a data-m="6451200" class="thewords">I just — while we&#x27;re on the subject of Mr. Dewey, I just wanted to urge everyone to visit the gravesite, which is on the north side of the chapel.  And it’s a very quiet, private place.  And it has a quite important inscription on the tomb.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6471800" class="thewords">And one of the quotes that I want to share with you is on his tombstone.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6477900" class="thewords">Councilor Brennan.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Brennan</span><span><a data-m="6481800" class="thewords">Thank you, President Shannon, and thank you, Mr. Gonzalez, for coming and sharing.  I wasn&#x27;t going to speak, but I felt the need to share with you, six years ago I was on the school board, and there was many talks of dismantling the schools in the Old North End, and bussing kids out of the community.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6510100" class="thewords">And a committee was formed — well, maybe, it was more than six years ago — but a committee	was formed, and there was many of us that were on the committee, and there was a professor, Charlie Rathbone that was on there.  And he indicated many of the things that we were doing to save our schools in the Old North End and make them magnet schools would&#x27;ve made John Dewey proud.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6539700" class="thewords">And I think that it’s a testament of what we actually have at the Integrated Arts and the Sustainability Academy, there&#x27;s some dedication to John Dewey in that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Gonzalez</span><span><a data-m="6550800" class="thewords">Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6551100" class="thewords">Thank you.  Councilor Blais&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Ccr. Blais</span><span><a data-m="6553400" class="thewords">President Shannon, thank you.  If I may, be it resolved by the city council of the city of Burlington as follows, that whereas John Dewey, philosopher and educator, who was born on October 20th, 1889  in Burlington, Vermont, and studied philosophy, graduating from the University of Vermont in 1879 before going on to teach at Columbia and the University of Chicago, and whereas John Dewey&#x27;s distinguished career included a particular interest in and substantial work on the philosophy of education,</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6587100" class="thewords">and whereas one of John Dewey&#x27;s enduring contributions to the discourse on education was to remind us that, &#x22;The child and the adult learn in identical ways,&#x22; and that we should, &#x22;encourage the child to think creatively and independently in solving a problem.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6608300" class="thewords">And to, &#x22;Test his ideas in actual practice and to profit from experience.&#x22;  And whereas John Dewey&#x27;s educational theories were based on an acknowledgement of and respect for the uniqueness of each individual, which would, in his opinion, promote tolerance and understanding between people.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6628900" class="thewords">And whereas John Dewey understood that education is necessary to preserve the values of a democratic society, and whereas honoring John Dewey by acknowledging the date of his birth provides an opportunity to celebrate, reflect, learn from each other, have fun and discuss the value of education.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6652000" class="thewords">Now, therefore be it resolved that October 20th, 2014 be declared John Dewey Day, and be it further resolved that the current John Dewey Parade be held on the Church Street Marketplace, and that a mask making event open to all people occur at the Fletcher Free Library prior to the parade.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6674700" class="thewords">Thank you, Councilor Blais.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="6678300" class="thewords">If there&#x27;s no further comment, I&#x27;ll go for a vote.  All those in favor of the resolution, recognition of John Dewey Day and annual John Dewey Parade and children&#x27;s event, please say aye.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Various</span><span><a data-m="6691400" class="thewords">Aye.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6692600" class="thewords">Any opposed&#x3f;  That is unanimous.  Thank you very much.  We appreciate all of your efforts.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">&#x5b;Plough&#x5d;</span><span><a data-m="6700500" class="thewords">And if I may say something, my name is Jean Plough, I&#x27;m a long&#x2d;time resident of Burlington.  And I&#x27;ve worked with Frank for over 30 years, in working in art classes in schools.  He&#x27;s, I would say, world&#x2d;renowned himself as  an art educator.  So I want to, on behalf of the John Dewey Committee, thank the council and the mayor, and Ron &#x5b;Redmond&#x5d; for his efforts to bring this proclamation forward.  So thank you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Pr. Shannon</span><span><a data-m="6738300" class="thewords">And I thank you on behalf of my daughter, who&#x27;s been a mask maker at your event.  Thank you.</a></span></p>
