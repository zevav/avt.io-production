    <p data-name="Ty Danco"><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="3900" class="thewords">Okay.  I&#x27;m here with David Bradbury, the majordomo of the Vermont startup scene.  David, introduce yourself and tell us about VCET.</a></span></p>
    <p data-name="David Bradbury"><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="11400" class="thewords">Sure.  Hey, I&#x27;m Dave Bradbury.  Welcome to VCET.  I think I best describe myself as a snowboarder, a recovering entrepreneur and an optimist for technology companies here in Vermont.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="22700" class="thewords">And you&#x27;ve attracted people like the Incredible Hulk, Spider&#x2d;man, Thor.  Looks like you got the entire crew here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="29500" class="thewords">Yeah, there&#x27;s definitely a lot in common with the superheroes on the wall and how we think entrepreneurs go about trying to drive change and take on the world.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="37900" class="thewords">Well, normally when I think of superheroes and Vermont, it’s Ben &#38;Jerry&#x27;s and Phish, but there&#x27;s other stuff going on.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="44700" class="thewords">Yeah, for sure.  I mean I think we&#x27;re pretty fortunate that we do get a lot of creative folks, and it’s not just limited to maybe some of the best craft brews in the world, some of the best skiing, or even some of the best food products.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="56500" class="thewords">You know, going back, let&#x27;s say 12 years or so, we really saw the first billion&#x2d;dollar exit in Vermont.  That was the &#x24;1.3 or &#x24;1.2 billion exit of IDX to GE Health Care.  More recently we&#x27;ve seen Dealer.com sell to Dealertrack, and that was just about a &#x24;1 billion exit of a high&#x2d;performing, great worker environment company that was dominating the auto industry for web services, web marketing related to auto sales.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="90700" class="thewords">So a lot of stuff happening.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="93100" class="thewords">And just as the idea that you need exits to start new companies, in a sense the IDX exit brought us MyWebGrocer, sort of keeping it in the family.  And MyWebGrocer seems to be typical of the companies, like Dealer, where they&#x27;re coming to Vermont for a happy programmer environment.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="115200" class="thewords">Yeah.  I mean MyWebGrocer&#x27;s a great example.  I would use other health care, like Marathon Health would be one.  Certainly, Union Street Media, one of the leaders in real estate web services arena.  You got Global&#x2d;Z down in southern Vermont, in Bennington, Inntopia in Stowe.  So there is a pretty vibrant story.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="135700" class="thewords">You know, it’s not deep.  There aren&#x27;t 25 or 30 of the same company here.  We have one or two cybersecurity companies.  Pwnie Express, for example, great story.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="145600" class="thewords">Pwnie spelled...&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="146700" class="thewords">Yeah, P&#x2d;W&#x2d;N&#x2d;I&#x2d;E.  &#x22;Pwn&#x22; means &#x22;to own&#x22;, penetrated and owned you.  And of course their t&#x2d;shirts say, &#x22;Get tested now,&#x22; which is awesome. &#x5b;laughter&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="157800" class="thewords">Okay.  But there&#x27;s also, you&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s this craft brewing.  There&#x27;s also sort of a crunchy granola angle, Seventh Generation.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="169700" class="thewords">Oh, sure.  I mean, you know —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="171000" class="thewords">Magic Hat —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="171900" class="thewords">Yeah, I mean the hippy influx in the &#x27;70s in Vermont really carries through to today.  And I think that&#x27;s been to our advantage in terms of startup culture.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="182800" class="thewords">You know, there&#x27;s 623,000 people up here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="185800" class="thewords">Which is about half of Estonia.  So maybe we have the next half of a Skype.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="189000" class="thewords">Well, it’s actually a pretty good proxy to the size of the city of Boston and the city of Nashville, for example.  And I think people choose to be here because they like the quality of life, they like the mountains, the clean air, the clean water, the school system.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="201700" class="thewords">And now that we&#x27;re connected, and sometimes hyperconnected to the world, you can do anything from anywhere.  And 623,000 of us have chosen Vermont to do it from.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="211900" class="thewords">Well, that&#x27;s right.  Are you a native&#x3f;  You&#x27;re one of the few non&#x2d;flatlanders here&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="216000" class="thewords">No, I grew up in Littleton, Massachusetts, which —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="219100" class="thewords">So you&#x27;re another flatlander.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="220200" class="thewords">Yeah, for sure.  I married a central Vermont woman, but you know, I look at Littleton, Mass., which, when I grew up, the milk was still delivered to the house, and today that&#x27;s where IBM has a 6,000&#x2d;person software campus.  So, you know, changes happen.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="236700" class="thewords">Well, this does seem to be an area which, you have to be attracted to it, and there are some companies that start in Vermont, like Bridj, which is a mass transit company, which naturally go out to a city like Boston &#x27;cause they&#x27;re trying to solve problems, like of subways.  But there are other companies like Ello, who leave other soporific climes like Boulder, but still come to Burlington.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="259000" class="thewords">What’s special about Burlington&#x3f;  Let me go at it this way: You&#x27;re sitting right on top of the matrix here.  Tell us about what you&#x27;ve got going here at VCET.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="267300" class="thewords">Sure.  Yeah, I think Bridj is a neat story.  I think it’s how they&#x27;re trying to take on transportation networks.  But let&#x27;s not forget, Bridj moved to Boston because of a girlfriend.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="278600" class="thewords">Oh, okay. &#x5b;laughs&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="279100" class="thewords">Okay&#x3f;  So let&#x27;s just correct that.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="280300" class="thewords">I moved to Vermont because of a girlfriend too.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="282000" class="thewords">Exactly.  I&#x27;m here as well.  So let&#x27;s not ever underestimate the power of a relationship to drive young people and where they choose to be, or even people our age, Ty.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="292400" class="thewords">You know, I think in terms of Paul Budnitz and his story, and moving his bicycle company from Boulder to the Burlington, Vermont area is really a great one.  You know, it is the aberration in terms of, in my opinion, people that move from a place like Boulder or Bozeman, or even a Telluride, for example, here, we do have a lot of common traits.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="313800" class="thewords">But you know, I think Burlington, I believe, at one point was the second or third cloudiest city in the nation, behind like Seattle.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="321200" class="thewords">Cleveland, Cleveland&#x27;s up there, I promise you.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="322200" class="thewords">Cleveland&#x27;s up there, yeah.  So, you know, we don&#x27;t get the blue skies days out west.  I do think we do share common traits, okay&#x3f;  It’s around innovation.  It’s definitely that sense of community.  And I think that&#x27;s a key point and a key differentiator up here.  Our community did not have to learn how to be mentors.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="340500" class="thewords">Our community did not have to learn how to take a young company in and give it a test bed.  We&#x27;ve always had to do it, just for survival, as a neighborly function, and because we have access to one another.  So I think when you look at advantages, I think that&#x27;s something that Vermont has, and it’s been really great to see places like Boston or New York City that have sort of developed this, &#x22;Hey, let&#x27;s be mentors and wrap ourselves around an accelerator program.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="369100" class="thewords">And that&#x27;s really exciting, and to the benefit of startups everywhere.  We talked about where we&#x27;re sitting today.  This is a new coworking facility.  It’s our third facility at VCET.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="381000" class="thewords">VCET standing for...&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="381800" class="thewords">Oh, sorry.  The Vermont Center For Emerging Technologies.  So we&#x27;re a non&#x2d;profit technology accelerator.  We have a venture capital fund that we invest out of as well to try to stand up promising new technologies and teams.  This third facility&#x27;s about 11,000 square feet, modern coworking facility in downtown Burlington, in partnership with FairPoint Communications.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="406400" class="thewords">This 11,000 square feet used to have upwards of 90 operators that worked here.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="410700" class="thewords">This is Lily Tomlin.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="412000" class="thewords">Yeah, Lily Tomlin.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Both</span><span><a data-m="412500" class="thewords">&#x22;One ringy&#x2d;dingy.&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="413400" class="thewords">Yeah.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="413900" class="thewords">Yeah.  And that&#x27;s no longer the... I don&#x27;t know where those folks are at.  It’s automated nowadays.  So what they wanted to do was put these idle spaces back to use.  We entered in a ten&#x2d;year partnership that them, and the reception over the last two weeks since we&#x27;ve formally opened has been fantastic.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="430700" class="thewords">But again, you&#x27;re sitting on top of some download speed which is comparable to the Google Fiber —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="438100" class="thewords">Oh, for sure.  I mean, our members have access to a gig, okay&#x3f;  We have so much bandwidth flowing through here because, again, as the landline provider, most all the backhaul from every other carrier comes through this building.  So I like to joke, this is where you jump into the matrix.  So there isn&#x27;t a thing that can&#x27;t be thought of, dreamed of or tested out of this facility.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="461700" class="thewords">And as you were saying, that while it is a coworking space, that theory of coworking goes back to the town hall meetings we still have all across Vermont.  Again, it’s a different type of collaborative issue.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="474500" class="thewords">Yeah.  And it’s really sort of changing the ecosystem up here.  For example, Seventh Generation is a company people may know.  Very successful consumer goods company.  Their management team was here, just using one of our neat rooms for an off&#x2d;site for a couple days.  They had a question about, &#x22;Gosh, what’s Twitter gonna be like, or how should we take advantage of that&#x3f;&#x22;</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="497700" class="thewords">And you know, we immediately were able to go across the room to Artur Adib, who&#x27;s a remote senior architect for Twitter, and let them have a discussion.  So it was great for both sides, and that exchange, that sort of curated environment here, we&#x27;re pretty excited about, and we&#x27;re starting to stand up smaller spaces all around our state, and connect &#x27;em.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="518400" class="thewords">Well, and this idea of the unknown power here — VCET&#x27;s invested in a few companies that have gone on to have some certain successes.  Can you throw us off some metrics&#x3f;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="530700" class="thewords">Yeah. I may have to go to my cheat sheet here, but each year we meet with about 200 teams.  We had 212 last year.  From our seed fund and through our sort of real hands&#x2d;on incubation program, we&#x27;ve had 43 companies that we would call our portfolio.  32 of them reported to us.  35 of them are still active, and this is over the last seven years.  They raised, last year, &#x24;20 million in capital.  They have &#x24;20 million in revenues.  They&#x27;ve got &#x24;15 million in payroll.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="561900" class="thewords">Cumulatively, those numbers are over &#x24;70 million now, &#x24;50 million in payroll.  So we think we&#x27;re starting to be a contributor to the economy, and certainly the real benefit these last few years are the new institutional investors that have made commitments in teams and in companies in Vermont, that heretofore never had.</a></span></p>
    <p><span><a data-m="584100" class="thewords">And I think that, again, shows we&#x27;re connected regionally.  We&#x27;ve got the people and the talent that are here.  And with angels like you, entrepreneurs like in this building, co&#x2d;investors from around the world, there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t stand up a couple great companies each year.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="602600" class="thewords">And instead of slogging in on the 6:23 train from Chappaqua, in the same time you could be out skiing The Chin or The Nosedive or something like that in Stowe.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="613600" class="thewords">Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I think, you know, I love in Stowe, and I snowboard quite a bit.  But when I snowboard, I&#x27;m usually with Jamie Goldstein from North Bridge or Dave Aronoff from Flybridge, or Justin Perreault from Commonwealth, or a host of others.  So there&#x27;s a lot of folks that recreate up here, that are both from the entrepreneur or the investment sector, again, in the New England region.  And that&#x27;s pretty exciting.  And you can have it all.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="640300" class="thewords">Thank you, Dave.  We&#x27;re going to add some pictures, but I think the thing that is perhaps most unknown is — let&#x27;s take a walk to the refrigerator.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="648900" class="thewords">&#x5b;laughs&#x5d;</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="652000" class="thewords">We can see some of the buildings around here.  It’s a big, beautiful facility, but this is, I think, the most rare... I&#x27;m not sure if you guys can see that.  But Heady Topper —</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Bradbury</span><span><a data-m="670500" class="thewords">You can&#x27;t find it.  And we try to stock it for our team, so when we have little end of day discussions.  But hey, thanks for visiting VCET, coworkbtv.com.  Thanks, Ty.</a></span></p>
    <p><span class="overidecolr">Danco</span><span><a data-m="683100" class="thewords">Bye.</a></span></p>
